# Crypto Tracker ðŸ¤‘

## Goal

The objective of this app is to learn about using Cupertino and Material Widgets in parallel and providing a different user interface depending on the platform.


## What is cooking!

I am going to make a crypto currency price checking app. By the end of the module, Ill be able to monitor crypto prices on the move!

## What my brain will get

- How to use the DropdownButton Widget from Material design.
- How to loop through code using Dart for and for-in loops.
- How to use Cupertino Widgets in your app.
- How to check the platform your app is being run on to customise the UI for that platform.
- Revise previous concepts by completing the challenges.
